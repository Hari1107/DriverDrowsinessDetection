The driver drowsiness detection system uses a webcam to monitor the driver's face and eye movements in real time. It detects signs of drowsiness, such as closed or partially closed eyes, and triggers alerts, like audio or visual cues, to prevent accidents. This cost-effective solution enhances traffic safety by quickly identifying and alerting sleepy drivers without the need for additional sensors.
